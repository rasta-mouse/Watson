## Issues

- I try to update Watson after every Patch Tuesday, but MS do sneak extra patches in for $reasons. For potential false positives, check the latest supersedence information in the [Windows Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx).  If you still think there's an error, raise an Issue with the `Bug` label.

- If there's a particular vulnerability that you want to see in Watson that's not already included, raise an Issue with the `Vulnerability Request` label and include the CVE number.

- If you know of a good exploit for any of the vulnerabilities in Watson, raise an Issue with the `Exploit Suggestion` label and provide a URL to the exploit.
